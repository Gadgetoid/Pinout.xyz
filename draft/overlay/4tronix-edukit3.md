#CamJam Edukit 3

The CamJam EduKit #3 is focused on robotics and contains this motor control board to allow you to create your very own Raspberry Pi-powered robot.

The board is in charge of the following :

 * Handle the two motors control (A & B);
 * Provide easy access to the unsused pins with the pass-through connector on its side.
