#Pinout!

###The comprehensive Raspberry Pi GPIO Pinout guide now with Raspberry Pi Model B+, Raspberry Pi 2 and Pi Zero.

This GPIO Pinout is designed to be both a quick-reference and a comprehensive guide to your Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

##What do these numbers mean?

* BCM - Broadcom pin number, commonly called "GPIO", these are the ones you probably want to use with RPi.GPIO and GPIO Zero
* WiringPi - Wiring Pi pin number (shown as a tooltip), for Gordon's Wiring Pi library
* Physical - Number corresponding to the pin's physical location on the header

##Raspberry Pi Zero

With the launch of the Pi Zero bringing Raspberry Pi into the hands of so many more people, we're pushing Pinout a little further with some visual tweaks and categorised menus to help you find what you need.

##Raspberry Pi 2

To celebrate the launch of the Pi 2 and the new Pi-enthusiasts it'll bring, Pinout has been updated to be cleaner, more comprehensive and more accurate and will continue to be improved.

##Raspberry Pi Model A+ and B+

Now that the Raspberry Pi Model B Plus is here, I've updated Pinout with the 14 extra pins you'll find on your shiny new board.

##Raspberry Pi Model "A" and "B"

Pinout was originally designed for the old 26-pin Raspberry Pi models, you'll see the outline of this original header displayed on the left in a slightly darker shade. If you click a pin you'll see details of its BCM pin assignment on the original Rev 1 Pi.
