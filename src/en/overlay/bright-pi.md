#Bright Pi

The Bright Pi is a breakout/add on board for the Raspberry Pi (can be used with other I2C devices too â€“ Arduino etc.) which adds both visible bright white light and infrared illumination to the Raspberry Pi, for use with the Raspberry Pi camera module, the Pi NoIR camera module or for any other project which requires bright LEDs.
