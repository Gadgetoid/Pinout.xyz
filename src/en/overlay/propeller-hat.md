#Propeller HAT

Propeller HAT brings the 8-core Parallax Propeller microcontroller to HAT form-factor. Program and talk to it over Serial using Propeller IDE and you'll have a powerful, realtime co-processor for your Pi.

It's like a little software programming logic device. Great for realtime IO, servo control and even convincingly synthesizing a SID chip.
