#ADC Differential Pi

The ADC Differential Pi is an 8 channel 18 bit analogue to digital converter designed to work with the Raspberry Pi A+, Raspberry Pi B+ and Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. The ADC Differential Pi is based on two Microchip MCP3424 A/D converters each containing 4 analogue inputs.  The MCP3424 is a delta-sigma A/D converter with low noise differential inputs.

##Features

- 8 x 18-bit differential inputs
- Control via the Raspberry Pi I2C port
- Stack up to 4 ADC Differential Pi boards on a single Raspberry Pi
- Jumper selectable I2C addresses (8 choices)
- Buffered 5V I2C port
- Based on the MCP3424 from Microchip Technologies Inc
- Input range of ±2.048V
- On-board 2.048V reference voltage (Accuracy  ± 0.05%, Drift: 15 ppm/°C)
- On-Board Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA): Gains of 1, 2, 4 or 8
- Programmable Data Rate Options:
    - 3.75 SPS (18 bits)
    - 15 SPS (16 bits)
    - 60 SPS (14 bits)
    - 240 SPS (12 bits)
- One-Shot or Continuous Conversion Options
